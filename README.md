### Links

- Live Site URL: [My live site](https://megankullu.github.io/four-card-feature-section-master/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I re-inforced my understanding of CSS Grid and used it majorly in laying out the site. I also used flexbox to style components inside the grids.


### Continued development

Looking to implement more challenges using flexbox to perfect my skills.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me when implementing positions of elements inside a grid container.
